Param/Value/lib_FC904078_05DEA601=The TvP bio playstyle is not very different from the ladder. If you choose mech, be aware that what makes traditional mech hold up in TvP are <c val="ffff8a">Vultures'</c> <c val="ffff8a">Spider Mines</c>.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_0EE65C85=Your race is <c val="ff0000">Terran</c>, your opponent's race is <c val="ff0000">Terran</c>.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_15344E2A=There's only one player left in team 1. Team 2 win.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_1865EA57=The fighters' units cannot mutate units in their hand. All units that require a second phase mutation as well as new units need to be selected by pressing the S button (default is S) twice when the bases are selected. The builder's <c val="ffff8a">Queens</c> cannot be released, but the <c val="ffff8a">Creep Tumors</c> can be shared.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_1D6E2B5D=Beware of your opponent's <c val="ffff8a">Scourges</c>, which are faster than most air forces. Late in the game <c val="ffff8a">Defilers</c> will appear, so you should avoid being blocked by opponents in your home, or getting out again will become very difficult.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_24A3435E=Tip: <c val="ffff8a">Sensor towers</c> have <c val="ffff8a">Scanner Sweep</c> Abilities and can be controlled directly by the fighter.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_35AB495A=If your opponent chooses to train some <c val="ffff8a">Mutalisks</c>, you have <c val="ffff8a">Goliaths</c> as a new option to supplement anti-aircraft firepower. The <c val="ffff8a">Science Vessel</c> in the Starport has the <c val="ffff8a">Irradiate</c> skill, which is very effective against the <c val="7f00ff">Zerg</c>.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_3A95C0C0=The tvz bio playstyle is a bit different from the ladder because you have <c val="ffff8a">Firebats</c>. As for mech, you have <c val="ffff8a">Vulture</c> as a new option. However, <c val="ffff8a">Vultures</c> can't deal splash damage, and they're weak against Zerglings.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_3DB5EEC6=There's only one player left in team 2. Team 1 win.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_51970D36=The <c val="ffff8a">Dragons</c> is very oppressive in the early game, and you may need to build a bunker early. If you encounter a combination of <c val="ffff8a">Warp Prisms</c> and <c val="ffff8a">Reavers</c>, be aware that their bullets are only effective when the Ravagers themselves are <c val="ffff8a">on the ground</c>. Do a good job of defending against <c val="ffff8a">Arbiters</c> later in the game, or your base may be destroyed instantly.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_5D526F8F=The <c val="ffff8a">Warhounds'</c> missiles only work on siege tanks. <c val="ffff8a">Science Vessels'</c> Irradiate and EMP abilities are powerful, so be careful when encountering them.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_5E932C76=If your opponent chooses to play bio, note that the presence of <c val="ffff8a">Medics</c> may early your opponent's attack time.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_6BDFA1FB=However, note that the Reavers' bullets are only effective when themselves are <c val="ffff8a">on the ground</c>, so be aware of this when using <c val="ffff8a">Warp Prisms</c>. The <c val="ffff8a">Arbiters</c> in Stargate are the ultimate spellcasting units, and their abilities are powerful enough to help you tear apart your opponent's defenses in the late game.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_6D0FEAA8=Bio vs bio is roughly the same as Ladder. If it's bio vs mech, watch out for <c val="ffff8a">vultures</c>. While <c val="ffff8a">vultures</c> have very little life, they are more than enough to deal with marines. Bio forces need <c val="ffff8a">Marauders</c> to deal with <c val="ffff8a">Vultures</c>.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_6E144569=Your <c val="ffff8a">Roaches</c> only have a population of 1.5. If you find that your opponent has built a large air force, you can try to use <c val="ffff8a">Scourges</c> to just run them over.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_6F43C3D2=Beware of your opponent's <c val="ffff8a">Scourges</c>, which are faster than most air forces, and are very deadly to <c val="ffff8a">Medivacs</c> and <c val="ffff8a">Science Vessels</c>. Late in the game <c val="ffff8a">Defilers</c> will appear, so you should avoid being blocked by opponents in your home, or getting out again will become very difficult.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_805DB513=Your opponent's <c val="ffff8a">Corsairs</c> is a big threat to the Mutalisks and Overlords, so watch out for early air defense.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_8663EA44=Tip: If defeat is assured, the <c val="ffff8a">Builder</c> can surrender by simply exiting the game or entering "-gg".
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_8835EEFA=Your role is <c val="ffff8a">Builder</c>, train soldiers for the fighters.

The <c val="ffff8a">Corsairs</c> in the Stargate have decent movement speed and air-to-air attack capabilities.
Param/Value/lib_FC904078_9E98DE5B=However, note that the Reavers' bullets are only effective when themselves are <c val="ffff8a">on the ground</c>, so be aware of this when using <c val="ffff8a">Warp Prisms</c>.

Param/Value/lib_FC904078_A57C1323=If your opponent has a large air force, upgrade <c val="ffff8a">Goliaths'</c> air-to-air weapon range as a solution. If you need EMP support, the <c val="ffff8a">Science Vessels</c> in the Starport can provide EMP support as well as Ghosts.
